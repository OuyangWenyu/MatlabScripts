# MatlabScripts

This is a repo from Kuai, which contains many codes for his papers. 
However there are a few comments on these codes, that is not enough to make the codes easy to read.

So now I am just adding some comments to the codes I will use for myself, and make them as matlab "live script".
Meanwhile, I also record some basics of Matlab.
